.SH NAME
cyberprobe \- Captures network packets and streams to a receiver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cyberprobe
[\fICONFIGURATION-FILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cyberprobe
is a network monitor which collects packets which match an IP address list.
The packets collected are streamed using network streaming protocols.
The IP address match list can be statically configured (in a configuration
file), can be dynamically changed using a management interface, or can be
dynamically changed as a result of
.B snort
alerts.

JSON configuration blocks:
.TP
.B control
The
.B control
element is optional, if it exists,
.B cyberprobe
runs a
management interface on the specified port. The
.B port,
.B username
and
.B password
attributes must be specified. See MANAGEMENT INTERFACE for
how to communicate with that interface.
.TP
.B interfaces
The
.B interfaces
block defines a set of interfaces to sniff. The
.B interface
attribute is mandatory, the
.B filter
element is optional, and if
specified should describe a BPF (Berkley Packet Filter)
expression. The
.B delay
element can be used to specify, in seconds, the
duration to wait before packets are processed. The delay is specified
as a floating point decimal.
.TP
.B targets
The
.B targets 
block defines the IP address or address ranges to collect, and defines
an IP address to device mapping. The
.B address
attribute defines the IP address used to match on (can be CIDR range), and the
.B device
attribute defines the device ID which will be record if this address matches
The address must be an IP address, and not a
hostname. The address can be an IPv6 address if the
.B class
attribute is
included, and set to
.B ipv6.
Device IDs can occur in multiple places in the
target block, but an IP address should only occur once in the target
block.
.TP
.B endpoints
The
.B endpoints
block defines a set of addresses for delivery. The
.B hostname
and
.B port
attributes should be used to describe the endpoint
address. Type
.B type
attribute should be
.B nhis1.1
or
.B etsi
to specify which output stream format to use.  The optional
.B transport
attribute can be
.B tcp
(default) or
.B tls
to identify use of TLS.  If TLS is specified, the
attributes
.B key
,
.B certificate
and
.B trust-ca
must be used to specify files containing PEM-format key,
certificate and trusted CA, all in PEM format.
.TP
.B parameters
The optional
.B parameters
block defines a set of parameters which are
only used in ETSI delivery. Each parameter element should have a
.B key
and a
.B value
attribute. The parameter values for
.B country,
.B operator,
.B network_element
and
.B interception_point
describe values which are used
in the PSHeader and IRI constructs. The parameters with prefix
.B username.
describe values for the username values in the IPIRI
construct in ETSI LI. The
.B key
value is the literal
.B username.
suffixed
with the LIID. If such an entry is present, it is used for the
username. All parameters are optional, meaningless defaults
(e.g. unknown) will be used if not specified.
.SH "MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL"
The management interface is a simple interface which supports studying
and dynamically changing the cyberprobe configuration: endpoints,
targets and interfaces.  The configuration file specifies a port
number, and username and password for the interface.
.PP
The interface is intended to be used programmatically, but it is
usable using a basic telnet. It is a command-response interface,
similar in style to SMTP.  Commands
.PP
Commands are sent, one at a time, as a string terminated by a
newline. The following commands are supported:
.TP
.B auth <user> <password>
Used on initial connection to authenticate.
.TP
.B help
Shows help
.TP
.B add_interface <iface> <delay> [<filter>]
Starts packet capture from an interface.
.TP
.B remove_interface <iface> <delay> [<filter>]
Removes a previously enabled packet capture.
.TP
.B interfaces
Lists all interfaces, output is format iface:delay:filter.
.TP
.B add_endpoint <host> <port> <type>
Adds an endpoint to delivery data to. where type is one of: etsi nhis1.1.
.TP
.B remove_endpoint <host> <port> <type>
Removes a previously enabled endpoint. where type is one of: etsi nhis1.1.
.TP
.B endpoints
Lists endpoints, format is host:port:type:description.
.TP
.B add_target <liid> <class> <address>
Adds a new targeted IP address. where class is one of: ipv4 ipv6
.TP
.B remove_target <liid> <class> <address>
Removes a previously targeted IP address. where class is one of: ipv4 ipv6
.TP
.B targets
Lists targets, format is liid:class:address.
.TP
.B add_parameter <key> <val>
Adds a new parameter, or changes a parameter value.
.TP
.B remove_target <key>
Removes a parameter value.
.TP
.B parameters
Lists parameters, format is key:value.
.PP
In response to a command, one of the following responses may occur:
.TP
An OK response,
which is a 200 status code and message. e.g. 200 Endpoint added.
.TP
An error message,
which is also a status code and message. e.g. 301 Command not known. 
.PP
Error codes always start with 3 or 5. A 3xx error code results from
something which is your fault e.g. procedural or syntactic violation,
5xx error codes result from errors internal to the system. This is
still probably your fault :) e.g. specifying an interface which
doesnâ€™t exist.
.PP
A response with a body, which is a 201 status code and message. This
is followed by a single line containing a response size in bytes,
followed by the response itself. e.g.
