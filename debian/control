Description: The Cyberprobe project is a distrbuted architecture for real-time
  monitoring of networks against attack.  The software consists of two
  components:
  - a probe, which collects data packets and forwards it over a network in
    standard streaming protocols.
  - a monitor, which receives the streamed packets, decodes the protocols,
    and interprets the information.
  These components can be used together or separately.  For a simple
  configuration, they can be run on the same host, for more complex
  environments, a number of probes can feed a single monitor.
  Please see documentation in /usr/share/doc/cyberprobe.
